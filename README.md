pythonArcGIStoolFindAdjacentTool
================================

A Python base ArcToolbox tool, "Find Adjacent & Neighboring Polygons", I published on ArcGIS resource in 2011, so this is kind of OLD!

There are better tools (GeoDa, ArcGIS spatial weight matrix, R) eleswhere, so I do NOT recommend this tool anymore :-)
